# Image search application with Backbone and Webpack. 

Application to search image with 500px api. 

### Purpose

This application is created as Proof Of Concept on combining these technologies: 

* Backbone / underscore
* JQuery
* React (as View)
* Webpack (support alias)
* ES6 support
* Unit testing with Jest

This application will be using combination of legacy code (backbone with requirejs), using alias in webpack and mix-match of es6 code (partial es6 and es5). 

This is not `production` code and should be considered as exercise or POC.
